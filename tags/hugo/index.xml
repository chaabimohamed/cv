      <description>Hugo is the best choice to build a simple static site, and of course, Hugo is one of the most popular static site generator, which has a great community that believes in it and supports making it as good as possible. Hugo is also using Markdown, which makes building static sites fast, flexible, and easy to modify. Also, you can use Hugo to make a site at a low cost if you use it with GitHub as a host and connect it with your domain name from a domain name provider such as GoDaddy, with no cost if you use GitHub Pages.</description>
